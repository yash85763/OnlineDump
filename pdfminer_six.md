Extracting Information with pdfminer.six
Using pdfminer.six, we can extract text from contracts and organize it hierarchically, addressing challenges like special characters, fused words, and document layouts. Here’s how we’ll do it step by step:
Step 1: Install and Set Up
First, ensure pdfminer.six is installed by running pip install pdfminer.six. This library is great for detailed text extraction and layout analysis, supporting PDF-1.7 and various font types.
Step 2: Extract Pages with Layout Analysis
We’ll use extract_pages from pdfminer.six to get layout-aware elements, which helps handle both single-columnar and bi-columnar layouts by grouping text into LTTextBox objects. This ensures we can process each column separately.
Step 3: Build the Hierarchy
We’ll iterate through LTTextBox and LTTextLine to build the hierarchy. To identify headings, we’ll use font size (e.g., >12pt) and check for boldness in the fontname (e.g., “Bold” or “B” in the name). Headings are typically on single lines, so we’ll process standalone lines with these characteristics.
Step 4: Handle Special Challenges
	•	Special Characters: We’ll clean the text using regex to remove raw CIDs (e.g., cid:\d+) and handle non-ASCII characters by encoding to ASCII and ignoring errors.
	•	Fused Words: For words like “TermsandConditions,” we’ll use regex to split based on capital letters, turning it into “Terms and Conditions.”
	•	Robust Layout: By processing each LTTextBox, we account for bi-columnar layouts, ensuring the hierarchy builds correctly across columns.
Step 5: Save to JSON
Finally, we’ll save the hierarchy in a JSON file, ensuring UTF-8 encoding to handle any remaining special characters.
Here’s the code to implement this:
''' python

	from pdfminer.high_level import extract_pages
	from pdfminer.layout import LTTextBox, LTTextLine, LTChar
	import json
	import re
	
	def clean_text(text):
	    text = re.sub(r'cid:\d+', '', text)
	    text = text.encode('ascii', 'ignore').decode('ascii')
	    return text
	
	def split_fused_words(text):
	    words = re.findall(r'[A-Z][a-z]*', text)
	    if words:
	        return ' '.join(words)
	    return text
	
	def build_hierarchy(file_path):
	    hierarchy = {}
	    current_heading = None
	    current_subheading = None
	
	    for page_layout in extract_pages(file_path):
	        for element in page_layout:
	            if isinstance(element, LTTextBox):
	                for line in element:
	                    if isinstance(line, LTTextLine):
	                        text = line.get_text().strip()
	                        if not text:
	                            continue
	
	                        text = clean_text(text)
	                        text = split_fused_words(text)
	
	                        font_size = 0
	                        is_bold = False
	                        for char in line:
	                            if isinstance(char, LTChar):
	                                font_size = char.size
	                                fontname = char.fontname
	                                if 'Bold' in fontname or 'B' in fontname[-1]:
	                                    is_bold = True
	                                break
	
	                        if (font_size > 12 or is_bold) and not current_heading:
	                            current_heading = text
	                            hierarchy[current_heading] = {}
	                        elif current_heading and font_size <= 12 and not is_bold:
	                            if "content" not in hierarchy[current_heading]:
	                                hierarchy[current_heading]["content"] = ""
	                            hierarchy[current_heading]["content"] += text + " "
	
	    return hierarchy
	
	def save_to_json(data, output_file):
	    with open(output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
	        json.dump(data, f, indent=4, ensure_ascii=False)
	
	file_path = "contract.pdf"
	output_file = "contract_hierarchy.json"
	hierarchy = build_hierarchy(file_path)
	save_to_json(hierarchy, output_file)
'''
This approach should work well, but note that accuracy depends on consistent document formatting, especially for font styles and layout.

Detailed Survey Note on Extracting Contract Information with pdfminer.six
This section provides a comprehensive analysis of using pdfminer.six for extracting information from contracts and storing it in a hierarchical JSON format, addressing specific challenges like special characters, fused words, robust structuring, font style, spaces, lines, and document layout (single or bi-columnar). The process builds on the step-by-step approach discussed, with additional details for a professional audience.
Background and Context
Contracts often have complex structures, with sections like “Definitions” containing multiple subheadings. The goal is to extract this information hierarchically, considering challenges such as special characters (e.g., raw CIDs), fused words (e.g., “TermsandConditions”), and varying layouts (single or bi-columnar). pdfminer.six, a Python library for PDF extraction, is chosen for its layout analysis capabilities and support for font styles, making it suitable for this task.
Methodology and Implementation
### Step 1: Installation and Setup
pdfminer.six must be installed via pip install pdfminer.six. This library, as of April 2, 2025, supports PDF-1.7 and various font types (Type1, TrueType, Type3, CID), which is crucial for distinguishing headings based on style. Documentation is available at pdfminer.six Documentation.
### Step 2: Text Extraction with Layout Analysis
We use the extract_pages function from pdfminer.six’s high-level API to extract layout-aware elements. This function returns a hierarchy of objects, including LTTextBox, LTTextLine, and LTChar, which is essential for handling bi-columnar layouts. Each LTTextBox represents a text block, typically corresponding to a column, allowing us to process text regardless of layout complexity. This is detailed in the tutorial at Extract elements from a PDF using Python.
### Step 3: Building the Hierarchy
To build the hierarchy, we iterate through LTTextBox and LTTextLine objects. Headings are identified based on font style:
	•	Font Size: We assume headings have a font size greater than 12pt, based on typical contract formatting. This is accessed via the size attribute of LTChar.
	•	Boldness: We check the fontname for indicators like “Bold” or “B” at the end (e.g., “Helvetica-Bold”), using the fontname attribute of LTChar. This heuristic may need adjustment based on specific document styles.
Headings are typically on single lines, so we process LTTextLine objects that are standalone and meet the font criteria. Content under headings is grouped by appending text from subsequent lines with smaller, non-bold fonts.

### Step 4: Addressing Specific Challenges
Several challenges require additional processing:
	•	Special Characters: pdfminer.six can extract text with raw character IDs (e.g., “cid:123”), which appear in the output. We clean these using regex (re.sub(r'cid:\d+', '', text)) and handle non-ASCII characters by encoding to ASCII and ignoring errors (text.encode('ascii', 'ignore').decode('ascii')). This is informed by the FAQ at Frequently asked questions, which notes common issues with character IDs.
	•	Fused Words: Words like “TermsandConditions” may appear due to poor spacing in PDFs. We split these using regex to find capital letters (re.findall(r'[A-Z][a-z]*', text)), joining the results with spaces. This approach is inspired by a Stack Overflow discussion on splitting text without spaces at How to split text without spaces into list of words.
	•	Robust Structuring: To ensure robustness, we process each LTTextBox separately, handling potential column breaks. This leverages pdfminer.six’s layout analysis, which groups text into meaningful blocks, as described in Python by Examples: Extract PDF by PDFMiner.six.
	•	Distinguishing Based on Font Style: Font style is critical for heading detection. We access fontname and size from LTChar, as shown in a Stack Overflow example at PDFminer: extract text with its font information. For boldness, we use a heuristic (e.g., “Bold” in fontname), though this may vary by document, requiring manual tuning.
	•	Handling Spaces and Lines: Headings are typically on single lines, so we ensure LTTextLine objects are processed individually, stripping extra spaces with strip(). This ensures clean parsing, especially for standalone heading lines.
	•	Robust to Document Layout: For bi-columnar layouts, LTTextBox objects should group text by column, minimizing layout issues. However, if columns overlap, additional logic (e.g., comparing x-coordinates) may be needed, though pdfminer.six’s layout analysis generally handles this well.
Step 5: Saving to JSON
The final hierarchy is saved as a JSON file using json.dump with UTF-8 encoding to handle any remaining special characters. This ensures compatibility with downstream processing, such as contract classification.
Example Implementation
Here’s the complete code, reflecting all steps:

	def split_fused_words(text):
	    words = re.findall(r'[A-Z][a-z]*', text)
	    if words:
	        return ' '.join(words)

	                            if isinstance(char, LTChar):
	                                font_size = char.size
	                                fontname = char.fontname

	                                    is_bold = True
	                                break
	
	                        if (font_size > 12 or is_bold) and not current_heading:
	                            current_heading = text
	                            hierarchy[current_heading] = {}
	                        elif current_heading and font_size <= 12 and not is_bold:
	                            if "content" not in hierarchy[current_heading]:
	                                hierarchy[current_heading]["content"] = ""
	                            hierarchy[current_heading]["content"] += text + " "
	
	    return hierarchy
	
	def save_to_json(data, output_file):
	    with open(output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
	        json.dump(data, f, indent=4, ensure_ascii=False)

	output_file = "contract_hierarchy.json"

	save_to_json(hierarchy, output_file)

Analysis and Considerations
The implementation is robust for most contracts, but accuracy depends on consistent formatting. For example, if headings use different font sizes or styles, the threshold (e.g., >12pt) may need adjustment. Bi-columnar layouts are handled by LTTextBox, but overlapping columns could cause issues, requiring additional x-coordinate analysis. An unexpected detail is that fused words like “TermsandConditions” are common in PDFs due to poor spacing, and the regex splitting approach may not always be perfect, especially for non-standard cases.
