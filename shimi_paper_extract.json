  "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and vector-based search have become foundational tools for memory in AI systems, yet they struggle with abstraction, scalability, and semantic precision—especially in decentralized environments. We present SHIMI (Semantic Hierarchical Memory Index), a unified architecture that models knowledge as a dynamically structured hierarchy of concepts, enabling agents to retrieve information based on meaning rather than surface similarity. SHIMI organizes memory into layered semantic nodes and supports top-down traversal from abstract intent to specific entities, offering more precise and explainable retrieval. Critically, SHIMI is natively designed for decentralized ecosystems, where agents maintain local memory trees and synchronize them asynchronously across networks. We introduce a lightweight sync protocol that leverages Merkle-DAG summaries, Bloom filters, and CRDT-style conflict resolution to enable partial synchronization with minimal overhead. Through benchmark experiments and use cases involving decentralized agent collaboration, we demonstrate SHIMI's advantages in retrieval accuracy, semantic fidelity, and scalability—positioning it as a core infrastructure layer for decentralized cognitive systems.",

    "SHIMI improves retrieval accuracy and interpretability while significantly reducing synchronization cost, positioning it as a foundational component for decentralized memory in emerging AI-native infrastructures.",
    "Unlike RAG and similar approaches, SHIMI embeds semantics into both its retrieval and synchronization layers, with each agent maintaining its own local semantic tree and updating it independently.",
    "SHIMI's partial sync mechanism leverages Merkle-DAG summaries and Bloom filters, resulting in over 90% reduction in data transferred during sync events compared to full replication approaches.",
    "The semantic tree's ability to prune large portions of memory before performing any deep matching results in a significantly lower number of comparisons per query.",
    "Despite entity growth, SHIMI's latency curve remains relatively flat, validating its use of pruning and hierarchical structure to avoid linear degradation."

      "text": "As decentralized computing moves beyond financial transactions into cognitive infrastructure, there is growing demand for intelligent agents capable of reasoning, adaptation, and autonomous coordination. From decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to blockchain-native AI agents, these systems require not only execution logic, but also access to structured, interpretable memory. Agents must retrieve knowledge, match tasks, and share context across evolving environments—yet most memory systems in AI today are neither explainable nor decentralized.",

      "text": "SHIMI organizes memory as a dynamic tree structure in which semantic abstractions are layered hierarchically. Formally, the memory is modeled as a rooted directed tree T = (V, E), where each node v ∈ V represents a semantic concept, and each directed edge (vi, vj) ∈ E encodes a parent-child relationship. Nodes may store entities, act as abstractions, or dynamically adapt their structure through merging.",

Nodes may store entities, act as abstractions, or dynamically adapt their structure through merging.\nWe define the following parameters, aligned with our implementation: T, the maximum number of child nodes under a parent (tree branching factor); L, the maximum number of abstraction levels used for generalization; δ ∈ [0, 1], the similarity threshold for placement or matching; and γ ∈ [0, 1], the compression ratio for semantic abstraction (word reduction).\nEach node v ∈ V contains: a semantic summary s(v) ∈ L; a list of children C(v) ⊆ V; a set of entities Ev ⊆ E; and a parent pointer p(v) ∈ V ∪ {⊥}."

Its partial synchronization mechanism enables bandwidth-efficient updates without sacrificing consistency, and its tree-based structure supports fast and explainable memory access. These properties make SHIMI particularly suited for settings where agents are autonomous, memory is dynamic, and infrastructure is decentralized."
