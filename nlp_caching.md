Key Points
	•	It seems likely that using Named Entity Recognition (NER) and vector embeddings can improve semantic query matching for caching, balancing general intent and specific details.
	•	Research suggests that queries with similar meanings but different specifics, like coin names, should be treated as distinct cache entries.
	•	The evidence leans toward combining cosine similarity for general text with exact matching for specific entities to avoid ignoring keywords.
Direct Answer
Overview
To make your cache system more semantic while avoiding the risk of ignoring keywords with vector cosine similarity, you can implement a hybrid approach. This method uses Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify specific details in queries and vector embeddings to capture general intent, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency.
How It Works
First, use a tool like spaCy to extract named entities (e.g., “Bitcoin” as a cryptocurrency, “last 6 months” as a date) from each query. Replace these entities with standardized placeholders based on their type to create a generalized text, such as “What is the price of [CryptoCurrency] in [Date]?” Compute an embedding for this generalized text using a model like Sentence-BERT. Store each cached result with both its generalized text embedding and the specific entity values (e.g., {“CryptoCurrency”: “Bitcoin”, “Date”: “last 6 months”}).
When a new query arrives, follow these steps:
	•	Extract named entities and create its generalized text.
	•	Compare the new query’s generalized text embedding with cached entries, looking for high cosine similarity (above a threshold, e.g., 0.8).
	•	Among similar entries, check if the specific entity values match exactly (e.g., same coin and date).
	•	If both conditions are met, it’s a cache hit; otherwise, process the query anew.
Expected Benefits
This approach ensures that queries like “Top trending coins?” and “What are some coins that have trended recently?” are cached together if their generalized texts are similar and have no conflicting specifics, improving efficiency. Conversely, “What is the price of Bitcoin in last 6 months?” and “What is the price of Ethereum in last 6 months?” won’t share a cache due to different entity values, preventing incorrect matches.
Unexpected Detail
You might find that fine-tuning the similarity threshold or expanding NER to include numbers (e.g., “top 10”) as specific details can further refine results, especially for queries with numerical variations.

Survey Note: Enhancing Semantic Query Matching for Caching Systems
This note explores a comprehensive approach to improve semantic query matching in caching systems, addressing the challenge of balancing general intent with specific details. The focus is on enhancing cache efficiency while ensuring accuracy, particularly for queries in financial or data-driven applications like cryptocurrency information systems. The methodology leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including Named Entity Recognition (NER) and vector embeddings, to create a robust caching strategy.
Background and Problem Statement
Caching is a critical technique for reducing latency in applications, especially those handling frequent user queries. The user has implemented parallelization and basic caching but notes that the current system relies on exact query matches, limiting its effectiveness. They aim to make query matching more semantic, allowing similar queries to share cache entries while avoiding mismatches due to ignored keywords. For instance:
	•	Queries like “Top trending coins?” and “What are some coins that have trended recently?” should share a cache entry due to similar intent.
	•	Queries like “What is the price of Bitcoin in last 6 months?” and “What is the price of Ethereum in last 6 months?” should not, as they differ in specific coin names.
The user is concerned that vector cosine similarity, while useful for semantic matching, might overlook crucial keywords, leading to incorrect cache hits.
Proposed Solution: Hybrid Semantic Caching
To address this, we propose a hybrid approach that combines semantic similarity for general intent with exact matching for specific details. The process involves the following steps:
	1	Named Entity Recognition (NER):
	◦	Use an NLP tool like spaCy to identify and categorize named entities in each query. For example:
	▪	“Bitcoin” might be labeled as “CryptoCurrency.”
	▪	“last 6 months” might be labeled as “DATE.”
	◦	This step ensures that specific terms, which are critical for query differentiation, are isolated.
	2	Generalized Text Creation:
	◦	Replace identified named entities with standardized placeholders based on their type to create a generalized text. For example:
	▪	Query “What is the price of Bitcoin in last 6 months?” becomes “What is the price of [CryptoCurrency] in [DATE]?”
	▪	Query “Top trending coins?” remains “Top trending coins?” if no named entities are found.
	◦	This generalized text captures the query’s structure and intent, abstracting away specific values.
	3	Embedding Generation:
	◦	Compute vector embeddings for the generalized text using a pre-trained model like Sentence-BERT. This model generates dense vector representations that capture semantic meaning, enabling cosine similarity comparisons.
	◦	For example, the embedding for “What is the price of [CryptoCurrency] in [DATE]?” would be consistent across queries with the same structure, regardless of specific entity values.
	4	Cache Storage and Retrieval:
	◦	Store each cached result with two components:
	▪	The embedding of the generalized text.
	▪	A dictionary of entity type to value pairs (e.g., {“CryptoCurrency”: “Bitcoin”, “DATE”: “last 6 months”}).
	◦	When a new query arrives:
	▪	Extract named entities, create its generalized text, and compute its embedding.
	▪	Compare the new query’s generalized text embedding with cached entries using cosine similarity, setting a threshold (e.g., 0.8) to determine semantic similarity.
	▪	Among entries with high similarity, check if their entity type value pairs match exactly with the new query’s pairs.
	▪	If both conditions are met (high similarity and identical entity pairs), it’s a cache hit; otherwise, process the query and cache the result.
Detailed Example
Consider the following queries to illustrate:
	•	Query A: “Top trending coins?”
	◦	NER: No named entities.
	◦	Generalized text: “Top trending coins?”
	◦	Embedding: Computed for “Top trending coins?”
	◦	Entity type value pairs: {}
	•	Query B: “What are some coins that have trended recently?”
	◦	NER: No named entities.
	◦	Generalized text: “What are some coins that have trended recently?”
	◦	Embedding: Computed for this text.
	◦	Entity type value pairs: {}
	◦	Comparison: If embeddings are similar (e.g., cosine similarity > 0.8) and both have empty entity pairs, they share a cache entry.
	•	Query C: “What is the price of Bitcoin in last 6 months?”
	◦	NER: “Bitcoin” (CryptoCurrency), “last 6 months” (DATE).
	◦	Generalized text: “What is the price of [CryptoCurrency] in [DATE]?”
	◦	Embedding: Computed for this generalized text.
	◦	Entity type value pairs: {“CryptoCurrency”: “Bitcoin”, “DATE”: “last 6 months”}
	•	Query D: “What is the price of Ethereum in last 6 months?”
	◦	NER: “Ethereum” (CryptoCurrency), “last 6 months” (DATE).
	◦	Generalized text: “What is the price of [CryptoCurrency] in [DATE]?”
	◦	Embedding: Same as Query C (same generalized text).
	◦	Entity type value pairs: {“CryptoCurrency”: “Ethereum”, “DATE”: “last 6 months”}
	◦	Comparison: Embeddings are identical (cosine similarity = 1), but entity pairs differ (“Bitcoin” vs. “Ethereum”), so they are distinct cache entries.
This approach ensures that queries with similar intent but different specifics are not mistakenly cached together, addressing the user’s concern about ignoring keywords.
Considerations and Edge Cases
	•	NER Accuracy: The effectiveness depends on the NER tool’s ability to correctly identify entities. For example, new cryptocurrencies not in the model’s knowledge base might be missed. Tools like spaCy can be fine-tuned for domain-specific entities.
	•	Numerical Variations: Queries like “top 10 trending coins?” and “top 20 trending coins?” may have “10” and “20” as quantities, which NER might label as “QUANTITY.” If treated as specific details, they would be distinct; otherwise, they’re part of general text, and similarity depends on embeddings.
	•	Threshold Tuning: The cosine similarity threshold (e.g., 0.8) needs empirical tuning based on application needs to balance false positives and negatives.
Implementation Details
To implement this, you’ll need:
	•	A NER library like spaCy for entity extraction.
	•	An embedding model like Sentence-BERT for generating text embeddings.
	•	A caching mechanism (e.g., Redis or in-memory store) to store (generalized text embedding, entity type value pairs) pairs and their results.
	•	A comparison function to compute cosine similarity and match entity pairs.

This might require additional configuration based on user needs, such as treating numbers as specific details for certain query types.
Conclusion

To address your request to think deeper about enhancing cache query matching to be more semantic while ensuring important keywords are not ignored, I’ve refined my previous response into a comprehensive solution. Your goal is to improve the cache system so that semantically similar queries (e.g., “Top trending coins?” and “What are some coins that have trended recently?”) share cache entries, while queries differing in critical details (e.g., “What is the price of Bitcoin in the last 6 months?” vs. “What is the price of Ethereum in the last 6 months?”) do not. Below is a detailed, self-contained approach that balances semantic flexibility with precision.

Proposed Solution: Hybrid NER and Vector Embeddings Approach
The solution combines Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify and preserve key details (like specific cryptocurrencies or time periods) with vector embeddings to capture the broader semantic intent of queries. This ensures that important keywords are respected while allowing flexibility for similar meanings.
How It Works
	1	Extract Entities with NER:
	◦	Use an NER tool (e.g., spaCy) to detect entities like “Bitcoin” (tagged as CryptoCurrency) or “last 6 months” (tagged as DATE).
	2	Generalize the Query:
	◦	Replace detected entities with placeholders to create a generalized version of the query. For example:
	▪	“What is the price of Bitcoin in last 6 months?” → “What is the price of [CryptoCurrency] in [DATE]?”
	3	Compute Vector Embeddings:
	◦	Use a pre-trained model like Sentence-BERT to generate an embedding for the generalized query, capturing its semantic structure.
	4	Cache Storage and Matching:
	◦	Store each cache entry as a tuple: (embedding of generalized query, dictionary of entity type-value pairs, result).
	◦	For a new query:
	▪	Generalize it and compute its embedding.
	▪	Find cached entries where:
	▪	The cosine similarity between embeddings exceeds a threshold (e.g., 0.8).
	▪	The entity type-value pairs match exactly.
	▪	If both conditions are satisfied, return the cached result; otherwise, process the query and cache the new result.

Why This Solves Your Problem
	•	Semantic Similarity:
	◦	Queries with similar intent but different wording (e.g., “Top trending coins?” and “What are some coins that have trended recently?”) will have similar generalized embeddings. If they lack conflicting entities, they can share a cache entry, improving efficiency.
	•	Precision with Keywords:
	◦	Queries differing in important details (e.g., “Bitcoin” vs. “Ethereum”) won’t match, even if their generalized embeddings are identical, because the entity values are checked for exact matches. This ensures critical keywords aren’t ignored.
	•	Balance:
	◦	By separating the general intent (handled by embeddings) from specific details (handled by entity matching), the system achieves both flexibility and accuracy.

Example Scenarios
Scenario 1: Different Entities
	•	Query 1: “What is the price of Bitcoin in last 6 months?”
	◦	Generalized: “What is the price of [CryptoCurrency] in [DATE]?”
	◦	Entities: {"CryptoCurrency": "Bitcoin", "DATE": "last 6 months"}
	•	Query 2: “What is the price of Ethereum in last 6 months?”
	◦	Generalized: “What is the price of [CryptoCurrency] in [DATE]?”
	◦	Entities: {"CryptoCurrency": "Ethereum", "DATE": "last 6 months"}
	•	Result: The embeddings match, but the entity values differ (Bitcoin ≠ Ethereum), so no cache hit.
Scenario 2: Semantically Similar Queries
	•	Query 1: “Top trending coins?”
	◦	Generalized: “Top trending coins?” (no entities detected)
	◦	Entities: {}
	•	Query 2: “What are some coins that have trended recently?”
	◦	Generalized: “What are some coins that have trended recently?” (no entities detected)
	◦	Entities: {}
	•	Result: If the embeddings are similar (e.g., cosine similarity > 0.8) and no entities conflict, it’s a cache hit.
Scenario 3: Same Entity, Different Structure
	•	Query 1: “What is the current price of Bitcoin?”
	◦	Generalized: “What is the current price of [CryptoCurrency]?”
	◦	Entities: {"CryptoCurrency": "Bitcoin"}
	•	Query 2: “How much does Bitcoin cost now?”
	◦	Generalized: “How much does [CryptoCurrency] cost now?”
	◦	Entities: {"CryptoCurrency": "Bitcoin"}
	•	Result: If embeddings are similar and entities match (Bitcoin = Bitcoin), it’s a cache hit.

Handling Edge Cases
	1	Queries Without Entities:
	◦	For queries like “Top trending coins?” vs. “What are the least trending coins?”, matching relies solely on embedding similarity. If their embeddings are too close (despite opposite meanings), incorrect cache hits could occur.
	◦	Solution: Increase the similarity threshold (e.g., to 0.9) or add a lightweight keyword check (e.g., ensure “top” and “least” are distinguished).
	2	NER Errors:
	◦	If NER misses an entity (e.g., fails to tag “Bitcoin”), the query won’t generalize correctly, leading to mismatches.
	◦	Solution: Fine-tune the NER model on domain-specific data (e.g., cryptocurrency names) to improve accuracy.
	3	Numerical Variations:
	◦	Queries like “Top 10 trending coins” vs. “Top 20 trending coins” could be treated differently based on whether numbers are entities.
	◦	Solution: Decide if numbers should be entity values (e.g., {"QUANTITY": "10"}) or part of the generalized text, depending on your caching needs.

Implementation Guide
Here’s how to implement this in Python:
Step 1: Set Up Tools
	•	NER: Use spaCy (en_core_web_sm or a custom model).
	•	Embeddings: Use Sentence-BERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2).
Step 2: Code Structure
import spacy
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

# Load models
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
embedder = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Cache storage (in-memory list for simplicity)
cache = []

# Generalize query and extract entities
def generalize_query(query):
    doc = nlp(query)
    generalized = query
    entities = {}
    for ent in doc.ents:
        placeholder = f"[{ent.label_}]"
        generalized = generalized.replace(ent.text, placeholder)
        entities[ent.label_] = ent.text
    return generalized, entities

# Compute embedding
def get_embedding(text):
    return embedder.encode(text)

# Check cache for a match
def check_cache(query, threshold=0.8):
    gen_query, entities = generalize_query(query)
    query_embedding = get_embedding(gen_query)
    for cached_embedding, cached_entities, result in cache:
        similarity = 1 - cosine(query_embedding, cached_embedding)
        if similarity > threshold and entities == cached_entities:
            return result
    return None

# Add result to cache
def add_to_cache(query, result):
    gen_query, entities = generalize_query(query)
    embedding = get_embedding(gen_query)
    cache.append((embedding, entities, result))

# Example usage
query1 = "What is the price of Bitcoin in last 6 months?"
result1 = "Bitcoin price: $30,000"  # Simulated result
add_to_cache(query1, result1)

query2 = "What is the price of Ethereum in last 6 months?"
cached_result = check_cache(query2)
if cached_result:
    print("Cache hit:", cached_result)
else:
    print("Cache miss")
    # Process query2 and add to cache
Step 3: Fine-Tuning
	•	Similarity Threshold: Experiment with values (e.g., 0.8–0.9) to balance hit rate and accuracy.
	•	NER Model: Train on cryptocurrency data if needed (e.g., add “Solana” or “Dogecoin” as CryptoCurrency entities).
	•	Monitoring: Log cache hits/misses to evaluate and adjust.

Enhancements for Your Use Case
	1	Domain-Specific NER:
	◦	Train the NER model to recognize niche entities (e.g., new coins or time expressions like “yesterday”).
	2	Threshold Tuning:
	◦	Test different cosine similarity thresholds to optimize for your query patterns.
	3	Numerical Handling:
	◦	Define whether numbers (e.g., “10” in “top 10”) should influence cache separation.
	4	Scalability:
	◦	Replace the in-memory list with a database (e.g., Redis) for production use.

Conclusion
This hybrid approach—using NER to preserve key details and vector embeddings for semantic similarity—directly addresses your needs. It moves beyond exact string matching to a smarter, semantic-aware cache system, while ensuring important keywords (like specific coin names) dictate when queries should not share cache entries. With minor adjustments (e.g., threshold tuning or NER refinement), it can be tailored to your specific application, improving both efficiency and user experience.
