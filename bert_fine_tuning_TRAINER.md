Let’s create a well-organized code structure for fine-tuning a BERT model for your multi-class classification task, based on the **full fine-tuning approach with class weights** to handle potential imbalance, as outlined in your article. I’ll provide a file organization structure, skeleton code for each file, and detailed comments explaining what each part does, why it’s used, and the input/output flow. This will align with your practical roadmap while keeping the implementation modular, reusable, and easy to debug.

### File Organization
Here’s a suggested directory structure to keep your project clean and scalable:

```
bert_classification_project/
│
├── data/                   # Directory for raw and processed data
│   ├── raw_data.csv        # Input: Questions and labels (e.g., "question,label")
│   └── processed/          # Output: Tokenized datasets (optional caching)
│
├── models/                 # Directory to save trained model and tokenizer
│   └── bert_finetuned/     # Output: Saved fine-tuned BERT model
│
├── src/                    # Source code directory
│   ├── __init__.py         # Makes src a Python package
│   ├── data_processing.py  # Data loading, tokenization, and dataset creation
│   ├── model.py            # Model definition and initialization
│   ├── train.py            # Training logic with class weights

└── requirements.txt        # Dependencies (e.g., transformers, torch, etc.)
```

### Skeleton Code with Explanations

#### 1. `config.py`
**Purpose**: Centralizes hyperparameters and file paths for easy tweaking and reproducibility.  
**Why**: Avoids hardcoding values in multiple files, making the codebase maintainable.

```python
# config.py
# Stores all configurable parameters and paths

# Paths
DATA_PATH = "data/raw_data.csv"
MODEL_DIR = "models/bert_finetuned"
PROCESSED_DIR = "data/processed"

# Model settings
MODEL_NAME = "bert-base-uncased"  # Pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face
NUM_LABELS = 5                    # Number of classes in your task
MAX_LENGTH = 128                  # Max token length for questions

# Training hyperparameters
BATCH_SIZE = 16
NUM_EPOCHS = 3
LEARNING_RATE = 2e-5
WEIGHT_DECAY = 0.01
WARMUP_STEPS = 0                  # For learning rate scheduler
```

**Input**: None (static config).  
**Output**: Variables used across the project.

---

#### 2. `src/data_processing.py`
**Purpose**: Loads data, tokenizes it, and creates a PyTorch Dataset.  
**Why**: Prepares your raw CSV data (questions + labels) for BERT training by converting text to model-readable tokens.

```python
# src/data_processing.py
# Handles data loading, tokenization, and dataset creation

import pandas as pd
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset
from transformers import BertTokenizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from config import DATA_PATH, MODEL_NAME, MAX_LENGTH

class QADataset(Dataset):
    """Custom Dataset for question-label pairs."""
    def __init__(self, encodings, labels):
        self.encodings = encodings  # Tokenized input (input_ids, attention_mask)
        self.labels = labels        # Class labels (e.g., 0, 1, 2, ...)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        item = {key: val[idx] for key, val in self.encodings.items()}
        item['labels'] = torch.tensor(self.labels[idx], dtype=torch.long)
        return item

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.labels)

def load_and_split_data():
    """Load CSV and split into train/val/test sets."""
    # Input: CSV with "question" and "label" columns
    df = pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH)
    questions = df['question'].tolist()
    labels = df['label'].tolist()

    # Stratified split to maintain class proportions
    train_texts, temp_texts, train_labels, temp_labels = train_test_split(
        questions, labels, test_size=0.2, stratify=labels, random_state=42
    )
    val_texts, test_texts, val_labels, test_labels = train_test_split(
        temp_texts, temp_labels, test_size=0.5, stratify=temp_labels, random_state=42
    )
    # Output: Lists of texts and labels for each split
    return (train_texts, train_labels), (val_texts, val_labels), (test_texts, test_labels)

def tokenize_data(texts, tokenizer):
    """Tokenize text using BERT tokenizer."""
    # Input: List of questions
    encodings = tokenizer(
        texts,
        truncation=True,
        padding=True,
        max_length=MAX_LENGTH,
        return_tensors="pt"
    )
    # Output: Dictionary with input_ids, attention_mask, etc.
    return encodings

def prepare_datasets():
    """Main function to process and return datasets."""
    tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)
    (train_texts, train_labels), (val_texts, val_labels), (test_texts, test_labels) = load_and_split_data()

    # Tokenize each split
    train_encodings = tokenize_data(train_texts, tokenizer)
    val_encodings = tokenize_data(val_texts, tokenizer)
    test_encodings = tokenize_data(test_texts, tokenizer)

    # Create datasets
    train_dataset = QADataset(train_encodings, train_labels)
    val_dataset = QADataset(val_encodings, val_labels)
    test_dataset = QADataset(test_encodings, test_labels)

    # Output: Datasets ready for training and evaluation
    return train_dataset, val_dataset, test_dataset, train_labels  # train_labels for class weights
```

**Input**: CSV file (`data/raw_data.csv`) with columns `question` (text) and `label` (int).  
**Output**: PyTorch Datasets (`train_dataset`, `val_dataset`, `test_dataset`) and `train_labels` for class weight computation.

---

#### 3. `src/model.py`
**Purpose**: Loads and configures the BERT model for classification.  
**Why**: Initializes the pre-trained BERT model with a classification head tailored to your number of classes.

```python
# src/model.py
# Defines and initializes the BERT model

from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification
from config import MODEL_NAME, NUM_LABELS

def load_model():
    """Load pre-trained BERT model with classification head."""
    # Input: Pre-trained model name and number of labels
    model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
        MODEL_NAME,
        num_labels=NUM_LABELS
    )
    # Output: Configured BERT model ready for fine-tuning
    return model
```

**Input**: Model name and number of labels from `config.py`.  
**Output**: A `BertForSequenceClassification` instance.

---

#### 4. `src/train.py`
**Purpose**: Implements the training loop with class weights to handle imbalance.  
**Why**: Fine-tunes the model on your data, optimizing weights to classify questions accurately while addressing imbalance.

```python
# src/train.py
# Training logic with class weights for imbalance

import torch
from transformers import AdamW, get_linear_schedule_with_warmup
from sklearn.utils.class_weight import compute_class_weight
from config import BATCH_SIZE, NUM_EPOCHS, LEARNING_RATE, WEIGHT_DECAY, WARMUP_STEPS
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

def compute_class_weights(labels, num_classes):
    """Compute weights to balance classes."""
    # Input: Train labels and number of classes
    class_weights = compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=range(num_classes), y=labels)
    return torch.tensor(class_weights, dtype=torch.float)

def train_model(model, train_dataset, val_dataset, train_labels, device):
    """Train the BERT model with class-weighted loss."""
    model.to(device)

    # DataLoaders for batching
    train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, shuffle=True)
    val_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE)

    # Optimizer and scheduler
    optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=LEARNING_RATE, weight_decay=WEIGHT_DECAY)
    total_steps = len(train_loader) * NUM_EPOCHS
    scheduler = get_linear_schedule_with_warmup(optimizer, num_warmup_steps=WARMUP_STEPS, num_training_steps=total_steps)

    # Class-weighted loss
    class_weights = compute_class_weights(train_labels, num_classes=model.config.num_labels).to(device)
    loss_fn = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=class_weights)

    # Training loop
    for epoch in range(NUM_EPOCHS):
        model.train()
        total_loss = 0
        for batch in train_loader:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            input_ids = batch['input_ids'].to(device)
            attention_mask = batch['attention_mask'].to(device)
            labels = batch['labels'].to(device)

            # Forward pass
            outputs = model(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, labels=labels)
            loss = loss_fn(outputs.logits, labels)  # Use weighted loss

            # Backward pass
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            scheduler.step()
            total_loss += loss.item()

        avg_train_loss = total_loss / len(train_loader)
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{NUM_EPOCHS}, Train Loss: {avg_train_loss:.4f}")

        # Validation
        model.eval()
        val_loss = 0
        with torch.no_grad():
            for batch in val_loader:
                input_ids = batch['input_ids'].to(device)
                attention_mask = batch['attention_mask'].to(device)
                labels = batch['labels'].to(device)
                outputs = model(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, labels=labels)
                val_loss += loss_fn(outputs.logits, labels).item()
        print(f"Validation Loss: {val_loss / len(val_loader):.4f}")

    # Output: Trained model (still in memory, save in main.py)
    return model
```

**Input**: Model, datasets, and training labels.  
**Output**: Fine-tuned BERT model (updated weights).

---

#### 5. `src/evaluate.py`
**Purpose**: Evaluates the model and provides inference functionality.  
**Why**: Assesses performance on the test set and allows predictions on new data.

```python
# src/evaluate.py
# Evaluation and inference utilities

import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score
from config import BATCH_SIZE

def evaluate_model(model, test_dataset, device):
    """Evaluate model performance on test set."""
    model.to(device)
    model.eval()
    test_loader = DataLoader(test_dataset, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE)
    
    preds, true_labels = [], []
    with torch.no_grad():
        for batch in test_loader:
            input_ids = batch['input_ids'].to(device)
            attention_mask = batch['attention_mask'].to(device)
            labels = batch['labels'].to(device)
            outputs = model(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
            preds.extend(outputs.logits.argmax(dim=-1).cpu().tolist())
            true_labels.extend(labels.cpu().tolist())

    # Output: Metrics
    accuracy = accuracy_score(true_labels, preds)
    f1 = f1_score(true_labels, preds, average='weighted')
    print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}, F1-Score: {f1:.4f}")
    return accuracy, f1

def predict(model, tokenizer, question, device):
    """Predict class for a single question."""
    model.to(device)
    model.eval()
    encodings = tokenizer([question], truncation=True, padding=True, max_length=128, return_tensors="pt")
    input_ids = encodings['input_ids'].to(device)
    attention_mask = encodings['attention_mask'].to(device)
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
        pred_class = outputs.logits.argmax(dim=-1).item()
    # Output: Predicted class ID
    return pred_class
```

**Input**: Model, test dataset or single question.  
**Output**: Metrics (accuracy, F1) or predicted class.

---

#### 6. `main.py`
**Purpose**: Orchestrates the entire pipeline.  
**Why**: Ties all modules together into a single executable script.

```python
# main.py
# Entry point to run the fine-tuning pipeline

import torch
from src.data_processing import prepare_datasets
from src.model import load_model
from src.train import train_model
from src.evaluate import evaluate_model
from config import MODEL_DIR

def main():
    device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
    print(f"Using device: {device}")

    # Prepare data
    train_dataset, val_dataset, test_dataset, train_labels = prepare_datasets()
    
    # Load model
    model = load_model()
    
    # Train
    trained_model = train_model(model, train_dataset, val_dataset, train_labels, device)
    
    # Evaluate
    evaluate_model(trained_model, test_dataset, device)
    
    # Save model
    trained_model.save_pretrained(MODEL_DIR)
    tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
    tokenizer.save_pretrained(MODEL_DIR)
    print(f"Model saved to {MODEL_DIR}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Input**: None (uses config and data files).  
**Output**: Trained model saved to `MODEL_DIR`, plus printed metrics.

---

#### 7. `requirements.txt`
**Purpose**: Lists dependencies for easy setup.  
**Why**: Ensures reproducibility across environments.

```
transformers==4.36.2
torch==2.0.1
pandas==2.0.3
scikit-learn==1.3.0
imbalanced-learn==0.11.0
```

---

### How It Fits Your Approach
- **Full Fine-Tuning**: All BERT layers + classification head are trained (`src/train.py`).
- **Class Weights**: Implemented in `train.py` to handle imbalance, as per your preference.
- **Practical Tips**: Modular design allows starting small (e.g., subset data in `data_processing.py`), monitoring via printed losses, and experimenting with `config.py`.

### Running the Code
1. Create `data/raw_data.csv` with your ~1500 samples (e.g., `question,label` format).
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run: `python main.py`.

This structure provides a robust, extensible foundation for your BERT fine-tuning task, aligning with your article’s roadmap! Let me know if you’d like adjustments or additional features (e.g., early stopping, data augmentation).

---
---

# Further Strategies we can employ:
Industry professionals employ a variety of strategies when fine-tuning BERT for multi-class classification tasks to optimize performance, prevent overfitting, handle data limitations, and ensure efficient resource use. Below, I’ll list and explain these strategies in detail, focusing on their purpose, implementation, advantages, and relevance to your scenario (~300 samples per class, potentially imbalanced dataset). These strategies complement early stopping and align with the practical considerations you outlined in your article.

---

### 1. Early Stopping
**Purpose**: Prevents overfitting by halting training when validation performance stops improving.  
**How It Works**: Monitors a metric (e.g., validation loss) and stops if no improvement occurs after a set number of epochs (patience). Restores the best model weights.  
**Implementation**: Track `best_val_loss`, increment a `patience_counter`, stop when patience is exceeded, and reload the best state (as shown in the previous `train.py`).  
**Advantages**: 
- Saves compute time.
- Ensures the model generalizes rather than memorizes.
**Challenges**: Requires a well-defined validation set and patience tuning.  
**Relevance to Your Scenario**: Critical with ~1500 samples and BERT’s 110M parameters, as overfitting is a risk.  

---

### 2. Learning Rate Scheduling
**Purpose**: Adjusts the learning rate dynamically during training to balance convergence speed and stability.  
**How It Works**: Gradually reduces the learning rate (e.g., linearly or exponentially) after an initial warmup phase to fine-tune weights more precisely.  
**Implementation**: Use `get_linear_schedule_with_warmup` from Hugging Face (already in your `train.py`):
```python
scheduler = get_linear_schedule_with_warmup(optimizer, num_warmup_steps=100, num_training_steps=total_steps)
scheduler.step()  # Called after each optimizer step
```
**Variants**: 
- Linear decay (common for BERT).
- Cosine annealing.
- Step decay (reduce LR by a factor every few epochs).  
**Advantages**: 
- Warmup prevents instability with small datasets.
- Decay improves fine-tuning of later layers.  
**Challenges**: Requires tuning warmup steps and total steps.  
**Relevance**: Helps stabilize training with your small dataset and default LR of 2e-5.  

---

### 3. Gradient Clipping
**Purpose**: Prevents exploding gradients, which can destabilize training in deep models like BERT.  
**How It Works**: Caps the gradient norm to a threshold (e.g., 1.0) before applying updates.  
**Implementation**: Add to the training loop in `train.py`:
```python
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=1.0)
optimizer.step()
```
**Advantages**: 
- Stabilizes training, especially with small batch sizes or imbalanced data.
- Simple to implement.  
**Challenges**: Threshold may need tuning (1.0 is a safe default).  
**Relevance**: Useful if your questions vary widely in length or complexity, potentially causing gradient spikes.  

---

### 4. Dropout Regularization
**Purpose**: Reduces overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training.  
**How It Works**: BERT already includes dropout (default 0.1) in its architecture (e.g., attention and feed-forward layers). You can adjust it.  
**Implementation**: Modify dropout in `BertForSequenceClassification` config:
```python
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=5, hidden_dropout_prob=0.2, attention_probs_dropout_prob=0.2)
```
**Advantages**: 
- Built-in regularization, no extra code needed.
- Effective with small datasets like yours.  
**Challenges**: Higher dropout (e.g., 0.3) may slow convergence.  
**Relevance**: Default dropout suffices, but increase to 0.2–0.3 if overfitting persists after early stopping.  

---

### 5. Class Weighting
**Purpose**: Mitigates class imbalance by penalizing misclassification of minority classes more heavily.  
**How It Works**: Assigns higher weights to underrepresented classes in the loss function (already in your `train.py`).  
**Implementation**: 
```python
class_weights = compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=range(num_classes), y=train_labels)
loss_fn = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=torch.tensor(class_weights).to(device))
```
**Advantages**: 
- Simple and effective for imbalance.
- No data modification needed.  
**Challenges**: May overemphasize minorities if weights are too extreme.  
**Relevance**: Ideal for your potentially imbalanced dataset, ensuring fair performance across classes.  

---

### 6. Data Augmentation
**Purpose**: Increases dataset size and diversity, especially for minority classes, to improve generalization.  
**How It Works**: Generates synthetic samples via techniques like synonym replacement, back-translation, or noise injection.  
**Implementation**: Use `nlpaug` or similar before tokenization in `data_processing.py`:
```python
import nlpaug.augmenter.word as naw
aug = naw.SynonymAug()
augmented_texts = [aug.augment(text)[0] for text in minority_texts]
```
**Variants**: 
- Synonym replacement (e.g., WordNet).
- Back-translation (translate to another language and back).
- Contextual word embeddings (e.g., BERT-based augmentation).  
**Advantages**: 
- Boosts minority class representation.
- Reduces overfitting with small datasets.  
**Challenges**: Risk of introducing noise or altering meaning.  
**Relevance**: Useful if your imbalance is severe (e.g., Class C: 200 vs. Class A: 500); apply selectively to minority classes.  

---

### 7. Focal Loss
**Purpose**: Focuses training on hard-to-classify examples (often minority classes) by down-weighting easy ones.  
**How It Works**: Modifies cross-entropy loss with a focusing parameter (gamma) and optional class weights.  
**Implementation**: Replace `CrossEntropyLoss` in `train.py`:
```python
from torch import nn
class FocalLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, gamma=2.0, weight=None):
        super().__init__()
        self.gamma = gamma
        self.weight = weight
    def forward(self, logits, targets):
        ce_loss = nn.functional.cross_entropy(logits, targets, weight=self.weight, reduction='none')
        pt = torch.exp(-ce_loss)
        return ((1 - pt) ** self.gamma * ce_loss).mean()

loss_fn = FocalLoss(gamma=2.0, weight=class_weights.to(device))
```
**Advantages**: 
- Addresses imbalance and hard examples.
- Complements class weighting.  
**Challenges**: Requires tuning gamma (2.0 is typical).  
**Relevance**: Switch to this if class weights alone don’t improve minority class performance.  

---

### 8. Layer-wise Learning Rate Decay (LLRD)
**Purpose**: Assigns different learning rates to BERT layers, with lower rates for early layers and higher rates for later layers/classifier.  
**How It Works**: Fine-tunes upper layers more aggressively while preserving pre-trained knowledge in lower layers.  
**Implementation**: Customize optimizer in `train.py`:
```python
from transformers import AdamW
param_groups = [
    {"params": model.bert.encoder.layer[:6].parameters(), "lr": LEARNING_RATE * 0.1},
    {"params": model.bert.encoder.layer[6:].parameters(), "lr": LEARNING_RATE * 0.5},
    {"params": model.classifier.parameters(), "lr": LEARNING_RATE}
]
optimizer = AdamW(param_groups, weight_decay=WEIGHT_DECAY)
```
**Advantages**: 
- Balances adaptation and preservation.
- Reduces overfitting risk with small data.  
**Challenges**: Requires layer-specific tuning.  
**Relevance**: Try if full fine-tuning overfits despite early stopping; good for your 300-sample-per-class size.  

---

### 9. Freezing Lower Layers (Partial Fine-Tuning)
**Purpose**: Reduces the number of trainable parameters to prevent overfitting and speed up training.  
**How It Works**: Freezes early BERT layers (e.g., first 6 of 12) and trains only upper layers + classifier.  
**Implementation**: Add to `model.py`:
```python
def load_model():
    model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=5)
    for param in model.bert.encoder.layer[:6].parameters():
        param.requires_grad = False  # Freeze lower layers
    return model
```
**Advantages**: 
- Faster training, less memory use.
- Preserves pre-trained features.  
**Challenges**: Less task-specific adaptation.  
**Relevance**: Alternative if full fine-tuning is too slow or overfits with your ~1500 samples.  

---

### 10. Mixed Precision Training
**Purpose**: Speeds up training and reduces memory usage by using 16-bit precision instead of 32-bit.  
**How It Works**: Leverages NVIDIA’s AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision) with PyTorch.  
**Implementation**: Wrap training in `train.py`:
```python
from torch.cuda.amp import GradScaler, autocast
scaler = GradScaler()
for batch in train_loader:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    with autocast():
        outputs = model(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, labels=labels)
        loss = loss_fn(outputs.logits, labels)
    scaler.scale(loss).backward()
    scaler.step(optimizer)
    scaler.update()
```
**Advantages**: 
- Faster training on GPUs.
- Fits larger batch sizes (e.g., 32 instead of 16).  
**Challenges**: Requires compatible hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Volta/Turing).  
**Relevance**: Use if training is slow on your GPU or you want to experiment with larger batches.  

---

### 11. Cross-Validation
**Purpose**: Provides a robust estimate of model performance by training on multiple data splits.  
**How It Works**: Splits data into k-folds (e.g., 5), trains on k-1 folds, validates on the remaining fold, and averages results.  
**Implementation**: Modify `main.py` to loop over folds (using `sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold`).  
**Advantages**: 
- Reduces variance in performance metrics.
- Maximizes use of small datasets.  
**Challenges**: Increases training time k-fold.  
**Relevance**: Optional for your ~1500 samples; use if you need reliable metric estimates beyond a single split.  

---

### 12. Hyperparameter Tuning
**Purpose**: Optimizes model performance by testing different configurations (e.g., learning rate, batch size).  
**How It Works**: Uses grid search, random search, or tools like Optuna/Ray Tune to explore parameter space.  
**Implementation**: Use Optuna to wrap `train.py`:
```python
import optuna
def objective(trial):
    lr = trial.suggest_loguniform('lr', 1e-5, 5e-5)
    batch_size = trial.suggest_categorical('batch_size', [8, 16, 32])
    # Train and return validation metric
study = optuna.create_study()
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=10)
```
**Advantages**: 
- Finds optimal settings systematically.
- Improves performance.  
**Challenges**: Computationally expensive.  
**Relevance**: Apply after initial runs if base settings (2e-5 LR, 16 batch) underperform.

### Applying to Your Scenario
Given your dataset (~300 samples/class, ~1500 total, potential imbalance):
- **Must-Haves**: Early stopping, class weighting, learning rate scheduling (already in your code).
- **Try Next**: Gradient clipping and dropout tweaking if instability/overfitting occurs.
- **If Needed**: Data augmentation or focal loss for severe imbalance; mixed precision for speed.
- **Advanced**: LLRD or freezing layers if full fine-tuning overfits; hyperparameter tuning for optimization.

These strategies collectively ensure robust, efficient, and balanced fine-tuning, tailored to industry standards and your specific constraints. Let me know if you’d like code for any additional strategy!
